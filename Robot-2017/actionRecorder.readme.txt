The autonomous code on this robot is based on the echo code that FRC team 1626 customized from
the LabView code it got from ChiefDelphi as Team 1153's echo code, and then ported and, again,
customized as the Java classes you see here.  The ActionRecorder class is constructed to be run
in an IterativeRobot.  It is believed that the task (which is left to the reader) of porting this
to a CommandRobot would be straightforward.

There are two classes used in the implementation of the ActionRecorder (which also handles playback):

	ActionRecorder
	DriverInput
	
DriverInput is the simpler class.  It just encapsulates all of the driver inputs from joysticks
and buttons at the driver's station as a collection of values.  Each input is given a name.  The
inputs are attached to a DriverInput object by name.  The inputs can be retrieved from the
DriverInput, as needed.

ActionRecorder manages recording and playback of autonomous routines, including mechanisms for
naming new autonomous recordings and selecting the recording to play back. On creation, buttons to
toggle the record mode and to scroll through the list of autonomous programs are specified.

The pattern is that there is a method, named when the ActionRecorder is instantiated, which is used
both to implement normal robot behaviors in teleop, and to implement autonomous robot behaviors in
autonomous mode.

When the robot enters disabled mode, if the robot is recording, then that recording is stopped and
written to disk.  Some analysis is done about how the timing of the previous playback behaved, and
the list of available recordings is gathered.  Then, in the disabled periodic method, ActionRecorder
watches the up, down, and recording buttons and takes the appropriate actions.

When the robot enters teleop mode, if recording is enabled, the robot sets up the file to record the
driver inputs.  During teleop mode, it is important that all of the driver inputs are used to create
a DriverInput object, and that all of the robot controls are implemented in the method that is called
by the ActionRecorder.input() method.  Anything that is coded outside of the robot operations method
will not happen in autonomous.

When the robot enters autonomous mode, the driver inputs are reloaded from the selected file, and are
played back with timing that matches, as well as possible, the timing at recording.
